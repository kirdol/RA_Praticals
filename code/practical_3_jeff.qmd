# Data Loading and Preparation

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# load the required packages and install them if they are not.
source(here::here("code","setup.R"))

# Load the data
data_temp <- read.csv(here("data", "Cleaned_Stations_Data_With_Names.csv"))

# Filter data for Nyon and remove any rows with NA in TAVG_C
data_nyon <- data_temp %>%
  filter(station_name == "Nyon") %>%
  select(DATE, TAVG_C) %>%
  mutate(DATE = as.Date(DATE)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(TAVG_C))
